      "Fears over radiation have created irrational pressures to dissuade radiography use within chiropractic. Recently, the regulatorybody for chiropractors practicing in British Columbia, Canada, the College of Chiropractors of British Columbia (CCBC),\n",
      "contracted Pierre C ˆot´e to review the clinical use of X-rays within the chiropractic profession. A “rapid review ”was performed\n",
      "and published quickly and included only 9 papers, the most recent dating from 2005; they concluded, “Given the inherent risks\n",
      "of radiation, we recommend that chiropractors do not use radiographs for the routine and repeat evaluation of the structureand function of the spine. ”The CCBC then launched an immediate review of the use of X-rays by chiropractors in their\n",
      "jurisdiction. Member and public opinion were gathered but not presented to their members. On February 4, 2021, the Collegeannounced amendments to their Professional Conduct Handbook that revoked X-ray rights for routine/repeat assessment andmanagement of patients with spine disorders. Here, we highlight current and historical evidence that substantiates that X-raysare not a public health threat. We also point out critical and insurmountable ﬂaws in the single paper used to support irrational\n",
